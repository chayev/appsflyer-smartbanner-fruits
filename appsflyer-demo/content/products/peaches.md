Nectarine, (Prunus persica), smooth-skinned peach of the family Rosaceae that is grown throughout the warmer temperate regions of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. A genetic variant of common peaches, the nectarine was most likely domesticated in China more than 4,000 years ago, and nectarine and peach trees are virtually indistinguishable. The expression of a recessive allele is thought to be responsible for the smooth skin of nectarine fruits, which lack the fuzzy trichomes (plant hairs) characteristic of peach fruits. The stones and kernels of the two fruits are alike in appearance and may be freestone types, which have ripe flesh that separates easily from the stone, or clingstones, which have flesh that adheres firmly to the stone. Nectarines have red, yellow, or white flesh and are a source of vitamins A and C. They are commonly eaten fresh or cooked in conserves, jams, and pies.
